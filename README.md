## 1. Introduction
The **Luminescence Dose and Age Calculator (LDAC)** is a *Microsoft Excel Visual Basic for Application* (VBA)-based package which can be used to assemble OSL age information and associated calculations. This platform applies statistical models to determine equivalent dose (De) values and render corresponding OSL age estimates. This software is fully applicable for De measurements by single grain and aliquot regeneration (SAR) and thermal transfer OSL (TT-OSL) protocols. It could also be used to calculate the dose rate and final buried age for geology/archaeology samples.

## 2. LDAC requirements
LDAC requires *Microsoft Excel 2010* or higher version (e.g., 2013, 2016, 2019) for *Windows* computers.

*Macintosh Excel* can be used to preview the data, but the *Macros* cannot be run. A Windows-enabling program (e.g., *Fusion, Parallels*) is to run **LDAC**.

## 3. Download the LDAC
The **LDAC** is continuously being developed and improved. The most recent (*July 22, 2019*) distribution of LDAC can be downloaded [above (*LDAC software (v1.0)*)](https://github.com/lesshsroc/LDAC/tree/master/LDAC%20software%20(v1.0)) or at [Geoluminescence Dating Research Lab, Baylor University](https://www.baylor.edu/geosciences/index.php?id=955927). A [training video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of_feY1UeqU) can be viewed on Youtube.

**Note: unzip the download zip file "*LDAC software (v1.0).zip*" and the “*LDAC (v1.0).xlsm*” will be found**.

## 4. Getting started
Make sure the downloaded workbook’s name is “*LDAC (v1.0).xlsm*”. if not, rename it.

Open the workbook just downloaded from the internet. A warning message will show “*PROTECTED VIEW Be careful-files from the internet can contain viruses. Unless you need to edit, it’s safer to stay in Protect-ed view*”. Click “**Enable Editing**” to use this program. 

On first running, the program **LDAC** might appear the following message “*SECURITY 
WARNING Some active content has been disabled. Click for more details*.” This is a warning message for using *Macros* and command buttons (ActiveX controls) of the Excel workbook. Click “**Enable Content**”. 

If this warning message cannot be displayed and any button on the worksheet is not responding, check the *macro settings* in the Trust Center (“*Excel>File>Options>Trust Center>Trust Center Set-tings>Macro settings*”). [Enabling or disabling Macros in Excel refer to the support document from the Microsoft website](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/enable-or-disable-macros-in-office-files-12b036fd-d140-4e74-b45e-16fed1a7e5c6).

## 5. Feedback
Although we have tried this program in lots of computers with different language version of *Windows* and *Microsoft Excels*, we believe that users may still encounter some unknown errors and bugs. 

Any bug-reports, suggestions, and even requirements for further developing the LDAC are warmly welcome. Please contact Peng Liang (Peng_Liang1@Baylor.edu; LiangPeng2012@live.cn) or Steven L. Forman (Steven_Forman@Baylor.edu). We will get back to you as soon as possible.
