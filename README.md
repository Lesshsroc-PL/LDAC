# Luminescence Dose and Age Calculator (LDAC v1.0)

## 1. Introduction
• The **Luminescence Dose and Age Calculator (LDAC)** is a *Microsoft Excel Visual Basic Application* (VBA)-based package which can be used to assemble OSL age information and associated calculations. This platform applies statistical models to determine equivalent dose (De) values and render corresponding OSL age estimates. This software is fully applicable for De measurements by single grain and aliquot regeneration (SAR) and thermal transfer OSL (TT-OSL) protocols. It could also be used to calculate the dose rate and final buried age for geology/archaeology samples.

• The **LDAC** is continuously being developed and improved. The most recent (*July 22, 2019*) distribution of LDAC can be downloaded above or at [Geoluminescence Dating Research Lab, Baylor University] (https://www.baylor.edu/geosciences/index.php?id=962356). A [training vedio] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of_feY1UeqU) can be viewed on Youtube.

• Note: Click the folder "[*LDAC software (v1.0)*] (https://github.com/lesshsroc/LDAC/tree/master/LDAC%20software%20(v1.0))" and download the zip file "*LDAC software (v1.0).zip*". Then, unzip the download file and the “**LDAC (v1.0).xlsm**” will be found.

• Any bug-reports, suggestions, and even requirements for further developing the LDAC are warmly welcome. Please contact Peng Liang (Peng_Liang1@Baylor.edu; LiangPeng2012@live.cn) or Steven L. Forman (Steven_Forman@Baylor.edu).

## 2. LDAC requirements
• LDAC requires *Microsoft Excel 2010* or higher version (e.g., 2013, 2016, 2019) for *Windows* computers.

• *Macintosh Excel* can be used to preview the data, but the *Macros* cannot be run. A Windows-enabling program (e.g., *Fusion, Parallels*) is to run **LDAC**.

## 3. First running the LDAC
• Make sure the downloaded workbook’s name is “LDAC (v1.0).xlsm”. if not, rename it.

• Open the workbook just downloaded from the internet. A warning message will show “*PROTECTED VIEW Be careful-files from the internet can contain viruses. Unless you need to edit, it’s safer to stay in Protect-ed view*”. Click “**Enable Editing**” to use this program. 

• On first running, the program **LDAC** might appear the following message “*SECURITY 
WARNING Some active content has been disabled. Click for more details*.” This is a warning message for using *Macros* and command buttons (ActiveX controls) of the Excel workbook. Click “**Enable Content**”. 

• If this warning message cannot be displayed and any button on the worksheet is not responding, check the macro settings in the Trust Center (“*Excel>File>Options>Trust Center>Trust Center Set-tings>Macro settings*”). [Enabling or disabling Macros in Excel refer to support document from Microsoft website] (https://support.office.com/en-us/article/enable-or-disable-macros-in-office-files-12b036fd-d140-4e74-b45e-16fed1a7e5c6)
